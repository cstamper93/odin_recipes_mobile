        <h2>Tasty Fluffy Eggs with Your Favorite Toasted Bread</h2>
        <p>This recipe is for a good ol' reliable breakfast! However, it can be enjoyed any time of the day. Use any type of bread that you enjoy the most. I use rye for the extra flavor.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 slice of bread</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>(optional) 2 tsp chopped parsley</li>
            <li>(optional) 1 pat butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack eggs into a bowl and stir to scramble</li>
            <li>In a skillet, add olive oil on medium heat</li>
            <li>Pour eggs into skillet with olive oil. Let them cook until edges start getting firm.</li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper to eggs</li>
            <li>While eggs begin to cook, begin toasting your eggs to desired crispiness</li>
            <li>Start scraping under the edges of the eggs with a spatula. Flip when firm enough to stay intact.</li>
            <li>Turn off heat and allow eggs to cook until desired firmness is reached</li>
            <li>Move your eggs and toast onto plate. Garnish your eggs with parsley and butter your toast if you desire, and enjoy!</li>
